## AIM:
Project aims at predicting whether a person is a heart disease patient or not based on various health attributes.

## Methodology:
1. The dataset will be extensively analyzed to comprehend the feature distributions, uncover possible correlations, and address any missing data or outliers.

2. Key features will be identified or generated to enhance the predictive performance of the model.

3. Different machine learning algorithms will be tested and compared to identify the most effective model for predicting heart disease.

4. The selected model will be assessed using relevant metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

The project aims to achieve a prediction accuracy of 95% or higher.

## Technology used:
Platform: Google Collab
Language and libraries: Python libraries used --> pandas, NumPy, MatplotLib, scikit-learn.
